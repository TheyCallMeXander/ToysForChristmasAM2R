# Xander's Addons for a certain search-action fan remake

This repository contains Addons for Modders to use in their mods.
- I will update addons with better code/features if I see the need
- New Addons will be added to this repository as they are created, tested, and proven
- To make changes/ add new Addons please contact @theycallmexander on discord, make an issue, or make a fork and attempt to merge your changes. I will review them if I see them, and add them if they are good changes.

If you're here to argue with me about licensing please wait until after this upcoming December 25th. If it is past December 25th I ask you to wait patiently until December 25h. If it is December 25th I ask that you wait until after December 25th.

If you continue to bother me after or during December 25th, or do not wait until December 25th, I will simply post the above statement to you directly.
