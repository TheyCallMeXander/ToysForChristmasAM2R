Projectile Gate, By Xander
This is code for a simple "ProjectileGate" Object. The Purpose of the Object is to block Player Projectiles from passing through, while allowing the player to pass through it. A common use-case could be using them alongside EMP-Zones (Like in Gravity Loop) to create non-combat areas like a player spawn point in a PVP gamemode, or to make enemies more threatening in specific situations.

-Installation Instructions-
1. Load the data.win for the project you want this to be used in in UTMT.
2. Once loaded, navigate to the Scripts/ResourceRepackers Tab and select "ImportGML.csx"
3. Navigate to the inclosed "Code" Folder and select it.
4. The script will ask you if you wish to automatically link imported code. Clicking Yes will prompt the app to create a new "oProjectileGate" Object if you do not have one.
5. If you do not have the oProjectileGate object, click yes on both options. If you do have the oProjectileGate Object and do not wish to automatically link code, click "No" and it will simply add it to the codebase.

-Additional Setup Instructions-
Make sure this is set up as a solid entity, and as a child to oSolid.

-Usage-
Can be used as an invisible zone, but I recommend using it alongside some kind of Energy Barriar Texture. Beams make the "Deflecting" sound and missiles will bounce off.

Merry Christmas, from Xander.
